                <p>My favorite hobbies: </p>
                  <ul>
                     <li>Playing sports - I used to train basketball for 8 years and played professionally for a couple of years for my home town club.
                         Besides basketball, in my free time I love to play and watch football and handball.
                     </li> 
                     <li>Playing a guitar - I was always impressed with the beauty of musical instruments, and a few years ago I started learning how to play a guitar.
                         It's still on of my favorite things to do, especially while taking a break from studying, because it relaxes me and clears my mind!
                        If u want to learn how to play, I highly recommend <a class = "klasa" href="https://www.ultimate-guitar.com/">Ultimate guitar</a>, it helped me a lot!</li>
                    <li>Listening to music - I'm a big fan of rock and rap music. My favorite rock bands are Deep Purple, Nirvana nad Pink Floyd. My favorite rappers are J Cole and Kendrick Lamar.
                    
                    </li>

                        Watcing movies and series - My favorite things to watch are anime and sci-fi movies.
                         If you're interested in this kind of stuff I highly recommend <a class = "klasa" href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0423731/">Samurai Champloo</a> (my favorite anime) or  <a class = "klasa" href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0816692/">Interstellar</a> (my favorite sci-fi movie), you won't regret it :)
